			<h3>Do you think the Parliament should pass the RTI Amendment Bill that keeps political parties out of the RTI Act?</h3>
			<p>The Right to Information (Amendment) Bill, 2013 seeks to amend the Right to Information Act 2005,
			removing political parties from the ambit of the definition of public authorities and hence from the purview
			of the RTI Act. If the amendment is passed by the parliament, citizens cannot access any information from
			political parties.

			<p>The proposed amendment is against the basic foundations of a vibrant democracy, i.e., transparency
			and accountability.</p>

			<p>In Sep 2013, Citizens campaigned forcing the Bill to be sent to the Parliamentary Standing Committee.
			It will be brought again in the Winter SeSsion of the Parliament, beginning on the 5th December.</p>

			<p>Its time to make your voice heard once again.. Find your MP

			know what you think.
